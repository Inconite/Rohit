            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <p>So, what will be needed to host your building? of course ground! (to host concrete, bricks, etc)</p>
            <p>So, in the same way, a hosting service is required to host all the data of your blog (such as codes, images, videos, etc)</p>
                      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard</p>
          <p>ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s</p>
          <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>
